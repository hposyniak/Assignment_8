//Deliverable 1:
//
// SMELL 1 - Primitive Obsession
//
//    Player and question should be objects, it would be much easier (and cleaner) if player and question were
//    object classes. The player class would keep track where on the board the player is, how many gold coins they have
//    and whether they are in a penalty box. The question class would keep track of all the questions and their types.
//    This smell is bad because it makes the code harder to read and adds unnecessary complications
//    and possible errors.
//
//SMELL 2 - Long Method
//
//    Method roll() is 38 lines long, usually when a method exceeds 10 lines of code we should look
//    into how to keep them shorter.
//
//SMELL 3 - Duplicate Code
//
//    In methods roll() and wasCorrectlyAnswered(), parts of code are duplicated.To fix this we
//    should implement an extract method, which will make the code more efficient, readable and
//    consistent. Duplicates affect the complexity of the code and impacts its performance.
//
//Deliverable 2:
// - the howManyPlayers() method is never used, which means the game never checks if there is enough players to play
// - the code has poor structure, is hard to read. The methods are not in order and have inconsistent names which makes
//	it harder to use them.
// - the code neither handles nor reports errors or exceptions which may lead to unexpected behaviours
